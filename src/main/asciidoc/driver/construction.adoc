[[driver-construction]]
= Construction

The driver package includes a graph database object.
// This object is used to create a driver.
This object provides driver instances.
When requesting a driver instance from the database object a URL is provided.
The URL declares the protocol, host name, and port for the Neo4j server.


[[driver-url-format]]
== Bolt URL format

A Bolt URL follows the standard URL pattern of `scheme://hostname:port`.
For example, `bolt://server:1234` would connect using the Bolt protocol to `server` on port `1234`.
If no port is provided in the URL, the default port `7687` is used.
For example, `bolt://server` amounts to the same as `bolt://server:7687`.
